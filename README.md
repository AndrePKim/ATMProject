# ATMProject
The ATM Project is a simple command-line application that simulates the basic functionalities of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) using Java. This project aims to provide an interactive interface for users to perform typical ATM operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, etc. The project is based on the tutorial by TechLiterate.
